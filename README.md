# Probabilistic_ROA_LyZNet
LyZNet code for Verifying Probabilistic Regions of Attraction with Neural Lyapunov Functions for Stochastic Systems

Note that the code for the toolbox [LyZNet](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3641513.3650134) is an extended stochastic version of the original LyZNet, which is available at https://git.uwaterloo.ca/hybrid-systems-lab/lyznet. To reproduce the results presented in the paper, please use the version provided in this repository.

To ensure the plotting part works correctly, please install the specific matplotlib version:
```bash
pip install matplotlib==3.7.5
